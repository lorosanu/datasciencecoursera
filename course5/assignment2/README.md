## Introduction

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health
and economic problems for communities and municipalities.
Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage,
and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanicand Atmospheric
Administration's (NOAA) storm database.
This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events
in the United States, including when and where they occur,
as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

## Data

The data for this assignment is stored in a CSV file
compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size.
You can download the file from the [course web site](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2).

There is also some documentation of the database available.
Here you will find how some of the variables are constructed/defined.
* National Weather Service [Storm Data Documentation](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf)
* National Climatic Data Center Storm Events [FAQ](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2FNCDC%20Storm%20Events-FAQ%20Page.pdf)

The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011.
In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded,
most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.

## Assignment

The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and to
answer the following questions about severe weather events:
* across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?
* across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

Use the database to answer these questions and show the code for the entire analysis.

Requirements
* document layout
  * the document should have a *title* that briefly summarizes the data analysis
  * immediately after the title, there should be a *synopsis* which describes and summarizes the analysis in at most 10 complete sentences
  * there should be a section titled *Data Processing* which describes how the data was loaded into R and processed for analysis
  * there should be a section titled *Results* in which the results are presented
  * the document should contain at least 1 and at most 3 figures
  * the document should show all the code for the analysis
* use the knitr package to compile the R Markdown document and convert it to HTML
* use RStudio to publish the completed analysis document to [RPubs.com](http://rpubs.com/).
